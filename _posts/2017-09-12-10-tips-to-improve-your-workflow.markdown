Roni Rosenfeld (B.Sc., mathematics and physics, 1985, Tel-Aviv University; M.Sc. 1991, Ph.D. 1994,
computer science, Carnegie Mellon University) is head of the Machine Learning Department and professor of
machine learning, language technologies, computer science and computational biology, in the School of
Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He also holds a courtesy
appointment at the Heinz School of Public Policy at Carnegie Mellon, and an adjunct appointment at the
University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine.

Rosenfeld has been teaching machine learning and statistical language modeling since 1997. He has taught
thousands of undergraduate and graduate students, has been a mentor to four post-doctoral students and an
advisor to about a dozen Ph.D. students and a score of Masters and undergraduate students.
Professor Rosenfeld's current interests include tracking and forecasting epidemics, using speech and
language technologies to aid international development, using machine learning for social good, and
advancing data numeracy for all. He has also performed research in statistical language modeling, machine
learning, speech recognition and viral evolution. He has published well over 100 scientific articles in academic
journals and conferences.

Rosenfeld is a recipient of the Allen Newell Medal for Research Excellence and of the Spira Teaching
Excellence Award.

###  The promise and peril of pandemic forecasting.
Forecasting a one-off pandemic (as opposed to repeated epidemics) is fraught with danger and has high potential for abuse and misuse.  Nonetheless, some forecasting-related tasks are doable, valuable, and could benefit from the application of AI.  It is useful to break out the forecasting problem as follows:

a) Nowcasting, namely the real-time estimation of epidemic quantities that are not immediately measurable, such as the pandemic’s current rate of growth at any particular location, the number of people currently infected, or even the number of people currently hospitalized (which is measurable in principle but often not in practice).  A related-problem is backcasting, namely the real-time estimation of epidemic quantities in the near past.  Nowcasting and backcasting are necessary components of forecasting, but also have their own independent utility.  The main technical problem here is the identification and integration of diverse data sources which are often noisy, unstable and correlated, to produce an optimal joint estimate.

b) Short-term forecasting focuses on a time frame of relatively little uncertainty (e.g. 2-3 weeks for the current pandemic).  Of people infected today, some fractions will develop symptoms, seek testing or medical care, get hospitalized, and/or die.  The distributions underlying these progressions change very slowly, and can thus be estimated accurately and used to project with reasonable confidence the number hospitalized, ventilated, and/or dead in the coming weeks.  Many local public health decisions can benefit from these fairly simple and accurate forecasts.

c) Longer-term forecasts rely on the future dynamics of transmission, which in turn depend not only on the virus and on environmental factors (both in principle predictable) but also on the behavior of people and governments – a much harder process to predict.  Further compounded by lack of relevant historical data and inability to statistically validate forecasts, longer-term forecasting is more dangerous than useful.  Nonetheless, scenario projections -- where comparisons are made between different interventions or under different assumptions -- can be helpful in suggesting intervention strategies or bounding the likely outcome.
