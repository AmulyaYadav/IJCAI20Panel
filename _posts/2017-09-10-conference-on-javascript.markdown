Milind Tambe is Gordon McKay Professor of Computer Science and Director of Center for Research in Computation and Society at Harvard University; concurrently, he is also Director "AI for Social Good" at Google Research India. Prof. Tambe's work  focuses on advancing AI and multiagent systems for public health, conservation & public safety, with a track record of building pioneering AI systems for social impact.
 
He is recipient of the IJCAI (International Joint Conference on AI) John McCarthy Award, ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) Autonomous Agents Research Award, AAAI (Association for Advancement of Artificial Intelligence)  Robert S. Engelmore Memorial Lecture Award, and he is a fellow of AAAI and ACM. He is also a recipient of the Columbus Fellowship Foundation Homeland security award, INFORMS Wagner prize for excellence in Operations Research practice, Rist Prize of the Military Operations Research Society, IBM Faculty Award, Okawa foundation faculty research award and several others. Prof. Tambe has contributed several foundational papers in Artificial Intelligence in areas of multiagent systems and computational game theory, for which he has received influential/best paper awards at a number of premier Artificial Intelligence venues, such as IJCAI, AAMAS and others. 



## Multi Agent Systems for COVID-19




COVID-19 (or coronavirus) is the greatest public health crisis that the world has experienced in the last century. Tackling it effectively requires the collective will of experts from a variety of disciplines. From a computer science perspective, Artificial Intelligence researchers have traditionally been at the forefront of responding to rapidly emerging societal needs. The panel will engage attendees in meaningful discussions around the different ways in which AI/ML research can help in tackling the COVID-19 pandemic.

 

Clearly, AI researchers have already made rapid strides in this space. For example, a lot of efforts have been made by AI researchers in developing agent-based models for simulating the transmission of COVID-19. In addition, AI researchers have proposed Markovian models for generated optimal sequential intervention strategies for effective imposition and release of lockdown protocols. At the same time, we have not yet seen the enormous potential of AI research being leveraged to design decision support systems (e.g., in the allocation of limited healthcare resources such as testing kits) which can assist epidemiologists and policy-makers in their fight against this pandemic.



While there exist many different areas in which AI can help in the fight against this pandemic, this panel will bring together world-reknowned AI and epidemiology experts to illustrate five different strands of AI research that can help in the fight against COVID-19. In particular, the panelists will be focusing on (i) AI for transmission modeling; (ii) AI for COVID-19 forecasting; (iii) AI for optimal healthcare resource utilization; (iv) AI (or NLP) on CORD-19 dataset; and (v) AI for Therapeutics and Vaccine Design. The panel's duration is one hour. At the beginning, each panelist will be making a short opening statement to set the context. Followed by that, there would be 30-40 minutes of Q&A with the audience, so the panel is meant to be highly interdisciplinary.
