Dr. Oren Etzioni has served as the Chief Executive Officer of the Allen Institute for AI (AI2) since its inception in 2014. He is Professor Emeritus, University of Washington as of October 2020 and a Venture Partner at the Madrona Venture Group since 2000. He has garnered several awards including Seattle’s Geek of the Year (2013), the Robert Engelmore Memorial Award (2007), the IJCAI Distinguished Paper Award (2005), AAAI Fellow (2003), and a National Young Investigator Award (1993). He has been the founder or co-founder of several companies, including Farecast (sold to Microsoft in 2008) and Decide (sold to eBay in 2013). He has written commentary on AI for The New York Times, Nature, Wired, and the MIT Technology Review. He helped to pioneer meta-search (1994), online comparison shopping (1996), machine reading (2006), and Open Information Extraction (2007). He has authored over 100 technical papers that have garnered over 2,000 highly influential citations on Semantic Scholar. He received his Ph.D. from Carnegie Mellon in 1991 and his B.A. from Harvard in 1986.



### CORD-19 for Mitigating COVID-19

Since the beginning of the year, thousands of papers have emerged about Covid-19, which is
why our Semantic Scholar at AI2 team leapt at the opportunity to collaborate with the White
House, NIH, Microsoft, and other partners to create the Covid-19 Open Research Dataset
(CORD-19): a free resource of over 275,000 scholarly articles about the novel coronavirus. Since
its launch in mid-March, this machine readable corpus has been viewed over 3M times and was
the focus of the most successful Kaggle competition to date. Over 50 tools, ranging from
question/answering search to data visualization, are now publicly available to assist researchers
and the medical community in solving the Covid crisis. This work was enabled by scaling NLP
from analyzing sentences and local context to document-level NLP and global context. The
implications of this work are a testament to the potential of AI to accelerate science. Not only
has this work made AI accessible to a wide range of researchers, it has also positioned AI as a
key contributor in fighting disease and demonstrated how broad access to scientific literature
for automated analysis and discovery can accelerate advancements in all aspects of research.
